## Goal

This repo is a testing ground for myself to learn a bunch of things related to implementing 2D games

## Controls

- Left and Right movement are bound to the Left and Right arrow keys, as well as the left stick/dpad on any connected controller.
- Jump with Spacebar or the Cross(PS) / B(Switch) / A(XBox) buttons
- Sprint with left Shift only for now
